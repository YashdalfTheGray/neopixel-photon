Making the neopixel ring an internet connected signaling device. 

## Running this file

This file needs the Neopixel library to be added to the project (in the Web IDE) to function properly. It has so far only been tested on the [24 LED Adafruit Neopixel ring](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2268).
